Using fork() system call we create child process of existing parent process. This fork() returns 0 to child process and child process's id to the parent process. getpid() command is used to get the process id of current process and getppid() command is used to get parent of current process. So in our output Parent's Id matches with Child's Parent Id and Child's Id matches with Child's current Id.
