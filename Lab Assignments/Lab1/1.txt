a.How many CPU and cores does the machine have?
Ans- There is 8 Processors and 4 cores.
CPUs = Threads per core X cores per socket X sockets
1)lscpu | grep -E '^Thread|^Core|^Socket|^CPU\('
2)cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l
  cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -m 1 'cpu cores'




b.What is the frequency of each CPU ?
Ans- cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "^[c]pu MHz"
cpu MHz		: 1998.000
cpu MHz		: 1998.000
cpu MHz		: 1998.000
cpu MHz		: 1998.000
cpu MHz		: 1998.000
cpu MHz		: 1998.000
cpu MHz		: 1998.000
cpu MHz		: 1998.000


c.How much memory does your system have?
Ans- cat /proc/meminfo | grep -m 1 'MemTotal'
MemTotal:        3952324 kB

d.How much of it is free and available? What is the difference between them?
Ans- 
MemFree:          234644 kB
MemAvailable:    1634148 kB
Differenece:     1399504 kB
    
e.What is total number of user-level processes in the system?
Ans- Tasks: 272 total,   1 running, 267 sleeping,   4 stopped,   0 zombie


COMMAND USED-:
1. lscpu,cat /proc/cpuinfo //for a and b part 
2. cat /proc/meminfo    //for c and d part
3. top // for e part
